# Camera IR Controller

This emulate
[ML-L3](https://www.nikon-image.com/products/accessory/remote/ml-l3/) for Nikon
Cameras on M5StickC.

## Usage

Point at the IR receiver of the Camera and click Button A.
Button A is the biggest button on M5StickC.

M5StickC has battery, so it works exactly like ML-L3.

If you change the IR transmission pattern, you should be able to use it for
other cameras, but I could not have this implementations because I do not have it.
If implemented, please cleate PR for this repository.
